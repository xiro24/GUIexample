I have included instructions on how to operate the program in the menubar, options -> instructions.
If it is unclear i hope the comments in the classes explain how the program operates.
Images used were drawn by me so i have not included any reference to them.
I have included some minor references from sites where i've used their regex, their links can
be found in the class where i've used them.

It is also should be noted that i automatically assign each player a unique ID starting at 1 which
increments whenever a new player is added to the game.
